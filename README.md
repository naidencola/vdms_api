# VDMS API exercise

An API implementation for the exercise request by VDMS.

Here are the various capabilities.

1. Add new product: POST /api/v1/products/
2. Retrieve all products: GET /api/v1/products/
3. Retrieve a single product by by code: GET /api/v1/products/:code (i.e. /api/v1/products/phone1)
4. Retrieve a list of products by Tag: GET /api/v1/products/?tag=tag (i.e. /api/v1/products/?tag=phone)


## Assumptions
1. In the schema validation I assumed there was a typo for the required fields, "required": ["id", "name"], as such I assumed the requirement was supposed to be,  "required": ["code", "name"].
2. Also in the schema, the description for the "code" field states:

	> The unique identifier for a product, autogenerated by the api

	however not sending the id would contradict with the required validation above.  I have just decided to overwrite the code of any new products with a newly generated id.
